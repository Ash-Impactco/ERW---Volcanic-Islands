## 🌋 SÃO MIGUEL FOCUS SUMMARY

### Location
- **Island:** São Miguel, Azores Archipelago, Portugal
- **Coordinates:** 37.78°N, 25.50°W
- **Area:** 744 km²
- **Population:** 140,000

### Why São Miguel?
1. **Abundant young basalts** (Quaternary volcanic flows)
2. **Perfect ERW climate** (2,500 mm rainfall, 17.5°C)
3. **Extensive agriculture** (250 km² dairy pastures)
4. **Island sustainability goals** (carbon neutrality)

### Key Hypothesis
**São Miguel's olivine-rich basalts can sequester 0.30-0.35 tCO₂/tonne over 10 years, providing 15,000-30,000 tCO₂/year island-scale CDR when integrated with local dairy agriculture.**

Accessible:   ~3,750 Mt (with 50% recovery)
Annual use:   50,000-100,000 tonnes/year (sustainable)
Supply:       37,500-75,000 years (essentially unlimited)
```

### CDR Potential
```
Conservative scenario: 50,000 t/yr → 15,000 tCO₂/yr
Moderate scenario:     75,000 t/yr → 22,500 tCO₂/yr
Aggressive scenario:   100,000 t/yr → 30,000 tCO₂/yr
─────────────────────
Offsets 2-4% of island's total emissions
```

python3 case_studies/sao_miguel.py
```

This will output:
- Basalt resource assessment
- Annual CDR scenarios
- Agricultural integration potential

### Step 2: Read Framework Documents

1. **`SAO_MIGUEL_RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md`** - Full scientific framework
2. **`research/SAO_MIGUEL_QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference

### Step 3: Customize With Your Data (If Available)

If you have actual São Miguel basalt samples, update the composition in:
```python
# In case_studies/sao_miguel.py, line ~10
SAO_MIGUEL_BASALT = {
    'SiO2': 48.5,   # Replace with your XRF data
    'MgO': 7.5,     # Replace with your data
    'CaO': 10.0,    # Replace with your data
    # ... etc
}
```

## 🌍 BROADER IMPACT

### Transferability to Other Volcanic Islands

São Miguel serves as a **model** for:
- **Azores archipelago:** 8 other islands (Terceira, Faial, Pico, etc.)
- **Canary Islands:** Similar climate, agriculture, geology
- **Cape Verde:** Tropical volcanic islands
- **Pacific islands:** Hawaii, Samoa, Fiji (volcanic basalts)
- **Caribbean:** Lesser Antilles volcanic arc

**Global potential:** 100+ volcanic islands could replicate São Miguel approach → 1-5 MtCO₂/yr CDR globally
