# Azores a Basalt Data (Potential Proxy for São Miguel)

**Source:** Azores basalt characterization  
**Note:** This data is from Azores Island, but could serve as a proxy for São Miguel until actual São Miguel samples are analyzed (both are Atlantic volcanic islands with similar basaltic composition).

## Key Observations for ERW

### Olivine-Bearing Basalt (Best for ERW)
- High MgO (8.38%) + CaO (9.45%) = 17.83% reactive silicate
- WPI = 0.377 (Excellent)
- Low porosity (5%) = dense, durable
- High strength (241 MPa compression)
- Low water absorption (1%)

### Brita 2 Stone Powder (Good for ERW)
- MgO (6.92%) + CaO (10.05%) = 16.97% reactive silicate
- WPI = 0.358 (Excellent)
- Fine grain size (0-4mm) = high reactive surface area
- Already processed and available

### Polished Basalt (Moderate for ERW)
- Lower MgO (2.70%) + CaO (5.34%) = 8.04% reactive silicate
- WPI = 0.160 (Moderate)
- High porosity (20.34%) = high surface area
- Lower strength (44.2 MPa)

## Comparison: Madeira vs. Expected São Miguel

| Parameter | Madeira (Actual) | São Miguel (Expected) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **SiO₂** | 47.2-50.3% | 47-49% | Similar basaltic range |
| **MgO** | 2.7-8.4% | 6-9% | São Miguel may be slightly higher |
| **CaO** | 5.3-10.1% | 9-11% | São Miguel likely higher |
| **Fe₂O₃** | 6.3-13.0% | 11-13% | Similar iron content |
| **WPI** | 0.16-0.38 | 0.33-0.40 | São Miguel likely higher |
| **Porosity** | 5-20% | 5-15% | Depends on flow type |
| **Age** | <5 Ma | <0.5 Ma | São Miguel younger = higher reactivity |

## Can Madeira Data Serve as São Miguel Proxy?

### Similarities (Justification for Proxy Use)
1. Both Atlantic Ocean volcanic islands
2. Similar basaltic composition (ocean island basalts)
3. Comparable mineralogy (olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase)
4. Similar climate (oceanic subtropical, high rainfall)

### Differences (Limitations to Note)
1. **Age:** São Miguel basalts younger (may be more reactive)
2. **Tectonic setting:** Slightly different (Azores triple junction vs. hotspot)
3. **Alkalinity:** São Miguel may be slightly more alkali-rich
4. **Exact composition:** Will vary by volcanic system

### Recommendation for Manuscript

If using Madeira data as proxy:

> "In the absence of comprehensive São Miguel basalt geochemical data, we use compositional data from Madeira Island basalts (Alves et al., 2017) as a reasonable proxy. Both islands are Atlantic volcanic systems with similar basaltic compositions (ocean island basalt affinity, olivine-bearing tholeiites to alkali basalts). We acknowledge this limitation and recommend field sampling of São Miguel basalts to validate our model predictions."

**Decision needed:** Use this Madeira data as proxy for São Miguel until actual São Miguel samples are collected and analyzed?
