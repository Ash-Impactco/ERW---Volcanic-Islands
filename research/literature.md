## Summary

São Miguel Island offers an ideal case study for volcanic island ERW due to:
1. Well-studied geology and basalt geochemistry
2. Documented climate data (high rainfall, moderate temperature)
3. Extensive dairy agriculture (ERW integration opportunity)
4. Island sustainability goals (carbon neutrality)

This literature provides the foundation for geochemical characterization, weathering modeling, and agricultural integration assessment.
